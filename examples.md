Here are examples illustrating how to start doing product analytics and cohort analysis in your web-based product, using only the instruments that you already have even on the earliest stage.

We access Google Analytics data from GSheets file using an official GA add-on and zero lines of code. We use a syntax of dynamic segments in GA API to build all sorts of things, including cohorts and funnel steps.

You can use these examples as a starting point for your product analytics and cohort analysis, or to try it out.

How to use these examples:
1. Open an example, go to menu File -> Make a copy
2. Now, in your copy of the file make sure you have Google Analytics add-on: go to menu Add-ons -> Get add-ons
3. Find "Google Analytics" add-on and add it.
4. Again, in your copied file open SETUP list and add your View ID.
How to get your View ID: 
Go to analytics.google.com
Open Admin menu, select Account, Property, and View, and click on View Settings. Find View ID number on that page. Copy it. Paste it on SETUP list in your copy of the example, in a highlighted cell. 
5. Go to menu Add-ons -> Google Analytics -> Run reports
See what happens.
